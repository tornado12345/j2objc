This package creates an Objective-C library that support tests that use
Mockito (https://code.google.com/p/mockito/), version 1.10.19. Source files
in this project include those modified from the Mockito distribution; the
other Mockito sources are extracted from the source distribution when building
(in build_output/java/).

Modifications:
  Added a mock maker that works with iOS and Mac OS X.
  Removed reference to Objenesis library, since iOS doesn't support bytecode.

Notes:

The IosMockMaker plugin is specified with an embedded resource file, defined
in its com/google/j2objc/mockito/IosMockMaker.java source. To change the
plugin's class name:

  . Update mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker with the new class.
  . Run "../../scripts/gen_resource_source.py -o output.res
         mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker"
  . Copy definitions from _mockito_extensions_org_mockito_plugins_MockMaker.h
         to the embedded resource section in IosMockMaker.java

Similar steps can be used to specify future Mockito plugins:

  . Create a mockito-extensions/<plugin-interface-name> file.
  . Add the name of the implementing class as a single line entry.
  . Run gen_resource_source.py on the new file.
  . Copy definitions from the generated header file to IosMockMaker.java.
